## Overview

The challenge was to build out a interactive rating component and get it as close as we possibly could to the original design.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
The process was as folows, i built out the html first using the markup provided, i then added the classes i needed for the styling , next i styled the project and added the state classes for hover and focus states.

The final step was to add the javascript for the buttons and the compoent to work , i also added in a error message that will show if you submit with selecting a rating number.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned
I learned the timeout method and how to refreh the page after a function runs.
